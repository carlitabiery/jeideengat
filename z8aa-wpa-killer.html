I posted this issue on Phabricator, but I think it's better if I post it here instead. amp#x200B; After that post, I did some tests to check whether I can find a pattern explaining what's happening, and it seems that suspending only works when the laptop is charging for the duration of the sleep. If I suspend it while it's not charging or unplug the charger during sleep, it ends up rebooting instead of resuming when I power it on again. amp#x200B; I also checked the vendor's website. I close the lid, the laptop sleeps, and it immediately wakes up again while closed. I press the sleep key, it goes to sleep, and immediately wakes up again. And I have no idea how to troubleshoot this. It works perfectly in a fresh boot - but after starting Firefox, emacs, Sublime Text, and god knows what, this happens.

So for the last couple of kernel versions I've been living with a broken suspend (sort of) and I cannot wrap my head around what's wrong. I have a Macbook pro mid 2015 (11,4) which suspends just fine, luckily it has never suffered from the instant wake up problem a lot of users report for the macbook models. The problem has been waking up again. It used to work fine during 4.15, some patches of 4.16 worked splendid as well, but as of lately the only way to wake up after opening WoodScents (https://i.imgur.com/snELZ7I.jpg) With Stems (https://i.imgur.com/9OglQdu.jpg) All Accessories (https://i.imgur.com/Hc3wBNv.jpg) Guys.

Alright, this is my last review for a few weeks so you better enjoy the long read :P Dreamstate has had a huge impact on trance only festivals in the US and Bliss Awakening is the first such event that's not been organised by Insomniac.
